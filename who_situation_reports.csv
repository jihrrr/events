<p>From 1 January 2024 to 26 May 2024, a cumulative total of 194 897 cholera cases and 1932 deaths were reported from 24 countries across five WHO regions, with the Eastern Mediterranean Region recording the highest numbers, followed by the African Region, the Region of the Americas, the South-East Asia Region, and the European Region. No outbreaks were reported in the Western Pacific Region during this time.</p><p>The global stockpile of Oral Cholera Vaccines (OCV) was depleted until early March but exceeded the emergency target of 5 million doses in early June for the first time in 2024. As of 10 June 2024, the stockpile has 6.2 million doses. However, demand for the vaccine continues to outpace supply. Since January 2023, 92 million OCV doses were requested by 16 countries, nearly double the 49 million doses produced during this period. </p><p>WHO classified the global resurgence of cholera as a grade 3 emergency in January 2023, the highest internal level for emergencies in WHO. Based on the number of outbreaks and their geographic expansion, alongside the shortage of vaccines and other resources, WHO continues to assess the risk at the global level as very high and the event remains classified as a grade 3 emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

and variants under monitoring (VUMs) continue to show increasing 
prevalence globally. They accounted for 22.7% and 22.4% of sequences in 
week 21 compared to 14.6% and 13.0% in week 18, respectively. Globally, 
JN.1 is the most reported variant of interest (VOI) (now reported by 132
 countries), accounting for 47.1% of sequences in week 21 and having 
declined from a prevalence of 56.0% in week 18.</p><p>Globally, the 
number of new cases decreased by 11% during the past 28-day period of 29
 April to 26 May 2024 compared to the previous 28-day period (1 to 28 
April 2024), with over one hundred and twenty-nine thousand new cases 
reported. The number of new deaths decreased by 36% as compared to the 
previous 28-day period, with over 1800 new fatalities reported. As of 26
 May 2024, over 775 million confirmed cases and more than seven million 
deaths have been reported globally.&nbsp;</p><p>During the period from 29 
April to 26 May 2024, COVID-19 new hospitalizations and admissions to an
 intensive care unit (ICU) both recorded an overall decrease of 57% and 
38% with over 14 000 and more than 400 admissions, respectively, from 
countries consistently reporting.</p><p>WHO published the latest <a href=""https://www.technet-21.org/en/resources/report/covid-19-vaccination-insights-report-07-june-2024"" data-mce-href=""https://www.technet-21.org/en/resources/report/covid-19-vaccination-insights-report-07-june-2024"">COVID-19 Vaccination Insights Report</a>

<p>World Health Organization compiles periodic summaries of the global epidemiology of Zika virus transmission and the update for 2024 is being submitted for publication as a peer reviewed manuscript, based on a review of global surveillance data and scientific publications. This will provide a comprehensive overview of Zika virus transmission and congenital Zika syndrome worldwide. In the interim, the map of countries with Zika transmission and list of countries with Zika and vectors has been updated to reflect changes since the last epidemiologic update in 2022. Zika transmission persists in several countries but has generally been at low levels throughout 2018 to the present. Since the last epidemiological update and based on peer-reviewed published data, three countries have been added to the list of countries with evidence of autochthonous, mosquito-borne transmission, and two countries to the list of countries with established&nbsp;<em>Aedes aegypti</em>populations but no documented Zika transmission.&nbsp; Findings underscore the importance of sustained vigilance to ensure integrated country preparedness for early detection and response, monitoring risk, vector control and the development of diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.</p><ul><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/emergencies/zika/countries-with-zika-and-vectors-table_21-may-2024.pdf?sfvrsn=b37d66a_1"">The list of countries with Zika and vectors</a></li><li><a target=""_blank"" href=""/images/default-source/wpro/health-topic/zika/zika_2024.png?sfvrsn=d4d18799_2"">Map of countries Zika transmission</a></li></ul>

        <h3>Overview </h3>
<p>The Greater Horn of Africa (GHoA) region faces severe challenges at the start of 2024, with an estimated 50.1 million people experiencing food insecurity crises. Of particular concern are 11.4 million children under five years old expected to suffer from acute malnutrition, with 2.9 million severely malnourished by June 2024. Disease outbreaks including cholera, measles, malaria, dengue fever, and others are rampant, exacerbated by factors like conflict, drought, flooding, displacement, and limited access to healthcare. Flood-affected areas in Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya have seen a surge in water and vector-borne diseases.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The region has over 24.1 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), refugees, and asylum seekers, with Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, and South Sudan reporting the highest numbers. Sudan, South Sudan, and Ethiopia are among the most food-insecure regions globally due to ongoing conflicts, flooding, and drought, leading to displacement, health facility damage, food price inflation, and increased malnutrition. These conditions hinder response efforts to disease outbreaks like cholera and measles, resulting in higher rates of illness and death.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

No outbreaks were reported in the Western Pacific Region during this time.</p><p>The cholera response continues to be affected by a critical shortage of Oral Cholera Vaccines (OCV). Since January 2023, OCV requests have surged, with 82 million doses requested by 15 countries, nearly double the 46 million doses produced during this period. The global stockpile of vaccines was depleted until early March. As of 6 May 2024, the stockpile has 3.2 million doses, which is below the global stockpile target of five million doses.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>WHO classified the global resurgence of cholera as a grade 3 emergency in January 2023, its highest internal level for emergencies. Based on the number of outbreaks and their geographic expansion, alongside the shortage of vaccines and other resources, WHO re-assed the risk at the global level as very high and the event remains classified as a grade 3 emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p>

        <h3>Overview </h3>
<p>During 2020, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses arose from previously circulating influenza A(H5Nx) viruses and spread predominantly via migratory birds to many parts of Africa, Asia and Europe. The epizootic has led to unprecedented numbers of deaths in wild birds and caused outbreaks in domestic poultry. In late 2021, these viruses crossed to North America and subsequently South America in October 2022. Additionally, globally, there have been increased detections of A(H5N1) viruses in non-avian species including wild and domestic (including companion and farmed) terrestrial and marine mammals and, more recently in goats and dairy cattle in the United States of America. The majority, with some regional exceptions, of the HPAI A(H5N1) viruses characterized genetically since 2020 belong to the 2.3.4.4b clade. Since the beginning of 2021, 28 detections of A(H5N1) in humans have been reported to WHO, including a case who had exposure to dairy cattle presumed to be infected with A(H5N1) virus. Of these human cases, where the haemagglutinin (HA) H5 clade is known, 13 have been caused by clade 2.3.4.4b viruses. This joint FAO/WHO/WOAH risk assessment focuses on A(H5N1) viruses characterized since 2021 and assesses the public health risk as well as the risk of the virus spread among animals.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of 2023, a cumulative total 824 479 cholera cases and 5900 deaths were reported from 31 countries across five WHO regions, as of 31 March 2024, with the Eastern Mediterranean region recording the highest numbers, followed by the African Region, the Region of the Americas, the South-East Asia Region, the Western Pacific Region. No outbreaks were reported in the European Region during this time.</p><p>The cholera response continues to be affected by a critical shortage of Oral Cholera Vaccines (OCV). Since January 2023, OCV requests have surged, with 79 million doses requested by 14 countries, double the 40 million doses available during this period. The global stockpile of vaccines was depleted until the beginning of March. As of 15 April, the stockpile has 2.3 million doses, which is below the global stockpile target of five million doses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>WHO classified the global resurgence of cholera as a grade 3 emergency in January 2023, its highest internal level for emergencies. Based on the number of outbreaks and their geographic expansion, alongside the shortage of vaccines and other resources, WHO re-assed the risk at the global level as very high and the event remains classified as a grade 3 emergency.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>Since the beginning of 2023, a cumulative total 787 813 cholera cases and 5586 deaths have been reported from 31 countries across five WHO regions, with the Eastern Mediterranean region recording the highest numbers, followed by the African, South-East Asia, Americas, and Western Pacific regions. No outbreaks have been reported in the European Region during this period.</p><p>The global cholera response continues to be affected by a critical shortage of Oral Cholera Vaccines (OCV). From January 2023 to February 2024, requests for OCV have surged, with 79 million doses requested by 14 countries, double the 40 million doses available during that period. The global stockpile of vaccines is awaiting replenishment and all production up to 4 March has been allocated to requests already approved. </p><p>WHO classified the global resurgence of cholera as a grade 3 emergency in January 2023, its highest internal level for emergencies. Based on the number of outbreaks and their geographic expansion, alongside the shortage of vaccines and other resources, WHO continues to assess the risk at the global level as very high and the event remains classified as a grade 3 emergency. </p>

本报告重点介绍了非洲之角面临的三级紧急情况。这一等级反映了该地区持续存在高水平粮食不安全和营养不良状况，以及不断恶化的影响健康状况。

**背景**

非洲之角是一个营养不良率较高的地区，这是由多重因素造成的，包括：

* **冲突和暴力**：索马里、埃塞俄比亚和肯尼亚的持续冲突导致粮食生产和分配中断，并迫使人们背井离乡。
* **气候变化**：极端天气事件，如干旱和洪水，已经破坏了农业生产，并减少了食物供应。
* **经济冲击**：新冠肺炎 (Covid-19) 大流行、俄乌战争和燃料价格上涨等经济冲击已经加剧了粮食不安全状况。

**粮食不安全**

粮食不安全是该地区面临的持续挑战，在埃塞俄比亚、肯尼亚和索马里的部分地区，约有 2400 万人面临粮食危机或更严重的情况。冲突和流离失所是粮食不安全的主要驱动因素，它们扰乱了粮食生产和供应。

**营养不良**

营养不良是粮食不安全的直接后果。非洲之角的营养不良率很高，特别是儿童，约有 800 万儿童患有急性营养不良，其中 130 万儿童患有严重急性营养不良。

**健康影响**

粮食不安全和营养不良对该地区的整体健康状况产生了负面影响。食物不足会导致营养不良，这会削弱免疫系统，增加患传染病的风险。在受粮食不安全影响最严重的地区，霍乱、麻疹和白喉等疾病已经暴发。

**应对措施**

正在采取措施应对非洲之角的粮食不安全和健康危机。这些措施包括：

* 提供紧急粮食援助
* 改善营养服务
* 支持农业生产
* 加强疾病监测和应对

**结论**

非洲之角面临着持续存在的粮食不安全和健康危机。如果不采取紧急行动，粮食不安全和营养不良状况将继续恶化，并对该地区的整体健康状况产生负面影响。国际社会必须迅速采取行动，解决造成这一危机的根本原因，并向受影响人群提供人道主义援助。","

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>The persistence of cholera is evident as 2024 begins, with 40 900 cases and 775 deaths reported in January alone from 17 countries across four regions: the African Region, the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the Region of the Americas, and the South-East Asia Region. Zambia and Zimbabwe have experienced the highest surges, underscoring the ongoing challenge of controlling cholera and the importance of sustained public health efforts. In 2023, cases were reported in 30 countries across five WHO regions, including nine countries that recorded more than 10 000 cases.</p><p>The global cholera response continues to be affected by a critical shortage of Oral Cholera Vaccines (OCV). From January 2023 to January 2024, urgent requests for OCV surged, with 76 million OCV doses requested by 14 countries while only 38 million doses were available during that time period. The global stockpile of vaccines is awaiting replenishment and all production up to 8 March will be allocated to requests already approved.</p><p>WHO classified the global resurgence of cholera as a grade 3 emergency in January 2023, its highest internal level for emergencies. Based on the number of outbreaks and their geographic expansion, alongside the shortage of vaccines and other resources, WHO continues to assess the risk at global level as very high and the event remains classified as a grade 3 emergency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Preliminary data from Member States indicate that the number of cholera cases reported in 2023 as of 15 December has surpassed that of 2022, with over 667 000 cases and 4000 deaths. These figures must be interpreted with caution given the varying surveillance systems and capacity across countries, which means that 2023 data are not directly comparable to reports from previous years.</p><p>Since the publication of the last situation report on the multi-country outbreak of cholera on 7 December 2023 (which included data up to 15 November), and as of 15 December 2023, one new country (Togo) has reported an outbreak of cholera or acute watery diarrhoea (AWD). In total, at least 30 countries have reported cases since 1 January 2023. </p><p>Nearly a year has passed since WHO classified the global resurgence of cholera as a grade 3 emergency, the highest internal level for a health emergency requiring a comprehensive response at the three levels of the organization. WHO is currently reviewing its response to cholera globally to identify key lessons and make evidence-based adjustments where needed to better coordinate activities in the coming months.</p><p>Based on the large number of outbreaks and their geographic expansion, alongside the shortage of vaccines and other resources, WHO continues to assess the risk at global level as very high.&nbsp;</p>

","**状况报告：非洲之角粮食不安全和健康——3 级紧急情况 — 2023 年 9 月 1 日至 10 月 31 日**

**主要发现**

* 受持续的干旱、冲突和经济危机影响，非洲之角正在经历一场前所未有的粮食不安全危机。

* 据估计，截至 2023 年 10 月，索马里、肯尼亚、埃塞俄比亚和吉布提将有超过 1800 万人面临粮食不安全。

* 在这些国家，预计将有 700 多万人处于 5 级紧急期（饥荒）。

* 营养不良率也在上升，预计 2023 年 10 月将有 1100 万儿童患上严重急性营养不良。

**响应措施**

* 人道主义机构正在加大对该地区的援助力度，重点关注粮食援助、营养干预以及医疗保健服务。

* 截至 2023 年 9 月，已经提供了近 20 亿美元的援助，但仍需要 45 亿美元才能满足当前需求。

**未来展望**

* 预计未来几个月粮食不安全状况将继续恶化，因为该地区的干旱仍在持续，并且冲突仍在继续。

* 缺乏资金和安全挑战将对人道主义响应构成重大障碍。

**征集号召**

* 呼吁国际社会加大对该地区的援助力度，提供所需的资金和资源以应对这场危机。

* 为人道主义机构提供安全和无障碍的通行权，以向需要的人提供援助至关重要。",,,2024-01-04,,"[""韩国"", ""苏丹""]",,https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/situation-report--greater-horn-of-africa-food-insecurity-and-health---grade-3-emergency---1-september---31-october-2023,who_situation_reports,https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/emergencies/ghoa-food-insecurity-and-health-sitrep--11-(sept-oct-2023).pdf?sfvrsn=4b4ddfd4_1&download=true,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-01-05 00:00:44,2024-06-18 11:17:04,,,,

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>Since the last multi-country cholera situation report published on 2 November 2023 (including data up to 15 October), no additional countries have reported new cholera or acute watery diarrhoea outbreaks as of 15 November 2023. However, new outbreaks have been reported within affected countries. In total, 29 countries have reported cases since 1 January 2023. The WHO African Region is the most impacted, with 16 countries reporting cases since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Preliminary 2023 data from Member States indicate that the number of cases reported this year as of 15 November has surpassed that of 2022, with over 610 000 cases and 3500 deaths, corresponding to a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.6%. This finding must be interpreted with caution given that 2023 data are not directly comparable to the more comprehensive official reports to WHO from previous years.</p><p>Given the extensive number of outbreaks, their widespread distribution, and the current shortage of vaccines and other resources, WHO continues to assess the risk at the global level as very high.</p>

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>Since the last situation report on the multi-country outbreak of
cholera was published on 5 October 2023 (covering data reported until 15 September), and as of 15 October 2023, no new country has reported an outbreak
of cholera or acute watery diarrhoea (AWD), although new outbreaks have been
reported within affected countries. In total, 29 countries have reported cases
since the beginning of 2023. The WHO African Region remains the most affected
region with 16 countries reporting cholera cases since the beginning of the
year.&nbsp;The overall capacity to respond to the multiple and simultaneous
outbreaks continues to be strained due to the global lack of resources,
including shortages of the oral cholera vaccine and cholera supplies, as well
as overstretched public health and medical personnel, who are dealing with
multiple parallel disease outbreaks and other health emergencies. Based on the
large number of outbreaks and their geographic expansion, as well as a lack of
vaccines and other resources, WHO continues to assess the risk at global level
as very high.<o:p></o:p></p><br>

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>Since the last situation report on the multi-country outbreak of cholera was published on 6 September 2023 (covering data reported until 15 of August), and as of 15 September 2023, a new outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) was reported from Iraq. In total, 29 countries have reported cases since the beginning of 2023. The WHO African Region remains the most affected region with 16 countries reporting cholera cases since the beginning of the year.&nbsp;The overall capacity to respond to the multiple and simultaneous outbreaks continues to be strained due to the global lack of resources, including shortages of the oral cholera vaccine and cholera supplies, as well as overstretched public health and medical personnel, who are dealing with multiple parallel disease outbreaks and other health emergencies. Based on the large number of outbreaks and their geographic expansion, as well as a lack of vaccines and other resources, WHO continues to assess the risk at global level as very high.</p>

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>In the last 28-day period (31 July to 27 August 2023), over 1.4 million new COVID-19 cases and over 1800 deaths were reported to WHO, an increase of 38% and a decrease of 50%, respectively, compared to the previous 28 days. As of 27 August 2023, over 770 million confirmed cases and over 6.9 million deaths have been reported globally. Three WHO regions reported increases in the number of cases, whereas two regions reported decreases. While three WHO regions reported decreases in the number of deaths, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Western Pacific regions reported increases in deaths.&nbsp; In this WEU edition, global figures include all available data from the Region of the Americas since the start of the pandemic up to 6 August 2023 reported through COVID-19 specific channels. However, 28-day comparisons for this Region and its Member States are presented using the integrated respiratory viruses surveillance data reported through FluNet and FluID platforms. Additional updates from this Region can be found in the <a href=""https://www.paho.org/en/influenza-situation-report"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">Influenza and Other Respiratory Virus weekly report</a>. Currently, reported cases do not accurately represent infection rates due to the reduction in testing and reporting globally.

","2023 年 8 月 30 日发布的流感在人畜共患界面评估摘要

**背景：**

自 2021 年 2 月以来，世界卫生组织（WHO）一直将一项监测在自然宿主（非人类动物）中发生的流感病毒演变的全球性计划作为其坚实的综合预防大流行流感战略的一部分。

**重点流感病毒变异**

最新一期的流感病毒监测报告 [1] 审查了 2021 年 4 月至 2023 年 3 月在世界范围内的禽流感、猪流感和生态系统其他方面检测到的流感病毒变异。

**对人类健康的影响**

此期间，人类感染禽流感病毒 A(H5N1)、A(H5N6) 和 A(H9N2) 的病例继续发生。禽流感 A(H5N1) 感染的人数显著增长，导致了更高的死亡率。这些病例主要集中在南美洲、北美和欧洲。值得注意的是，受影响的几乎所有病例都与直接接触受感染的禽类或受污染的环境有关。

猪流感病毒变异持续存在于猪群中，但尚未发现对人类构成严重威胁的新出现变异。

**针对疫情的行动**

动物卫生部门继续加强流感病毒监测，重点关注流感病毒从动物传播到人的潜在风险。人类卫生部门正在监测人类感染病例，并为病例检测和接触者追踪提供支持。

**WHO 评估**

尽管观察到禽流感病毒变异，但目前还没有迹象表明大流行性流感的影响即将到来。然而，持续的监测和基于风险的公共卫生对策对于早期发现和应对新出现的威胁至关重要。

**建议**

* 继续对禽流感病毒变异进行监测，并加强对动物-人类界面的风险评估。
* 在受影响地区加强病例检测和接触者追踪。
* 为高危人群提供抗病毒药物和疫苗，必要时进行治疗。
* 加强公共宣教工作，提高对禽流感风险及其预防措施的认识。
* 加强动物卫生措施，以防止病毒在动物之间传播。

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>In the last 28-day period (17 July to 13 August 2023), over 1.4 million new COVID-19 cases and over 2300 deaths were reported from WHO’s six regions, an increase of 63% and a decrease of 56%, respectively, compared to the previous 28 days. As of 13 August 2023, over 769 million confirmed cases and over 6.9 million deaths have been reported globally. While four WHO regions have reported decreases in the number of both cases and deaths, the Western Pacific Region has reported an increase in cases and a decrease in deaths. In the context of high variability in the timeliness of COVID-19 reports produced by Member States in the Americas, as of August 2023 PAHO/WHO has paused its specific COVID-19 Epidemiological Update. Subsequent COVID-19 surveillance will continue through the Influenza ad Other Respiratory Viruses bulletin and dashboards available here: <a href=""https://www.paho.org/en/topics/influenza-and-other-respiratory-viruses"" data-sf-ec-immutable="""">https://www.paho.org/en/topics/influenza-and-other-respiratory-viruses</a>.

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>Since the last situation report on the multi-country outbreak of cholera was published on 6 July 2023 (covering data reported until 15 of June), and as of 15 July 2023, one new outbreak of cholera was reported from India on 15 May 2023. In total, 25 countries have reported cases since the beginning of 2023. The WHO African Region remains the most affected region with 14 countries reporting cholera cases since the beginning of the year. The overall capacity to respond to the multiple and simultaneous outbreaks continues to be strained due to the global lack of resources, including shortages of the Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) and cholera supplies, as well as overstretched public health and medical personnel, who are dealing with multiple parallel disease outbreaks and other health emergencies. Based on the large number of outbreaks and their geographic expansion, as well as a lack of vaccines and other resources, WHO continues to assess the risk at global level as very high.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Globally, over 794 000 new COVID-19 cases and over 4800 deaths were reported in the last 28 days (12 June to 9 July 2023). While five WHO regions have reported decreases in the number of both cases and deaths, the African Region has reported a decline in cases but an increase in deaths – albeit from a relatively low baseline. As of 9 July 2023, over 767 million confirmed cases and over 6.9 million deaths have been reported globally. Reported cases are not an accurate representation of infection rates due to the reduction in testing and reporting globally. During this 28-day period, 57% (133 of 234) of countries and territories reported at least one case – a proportion that has been declining since mid-2022.</p> <p>In this edition, we include:</p><ul type=""disc""><li data-list=""0"" data-level=""1"">The COVID-19 epidemiological update at the global and the regional levels</li><li data-list=""0"" data-level=""1"">An update on hospitalizations and ICU admissions</li><li data-list=""0"" data-level=""1"">An update on the SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest (VOI) and variants under monitoring (VUM)</li></ul><p></p>

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>Since the last situation report on the multi-country outbreak of cholera was published on 1 June 2023 (covering data reported until 15 of May), no new country reported a cholera outbreak. In total, 24 countries have reported cases since the beginning of 2023. The WHO African Region remains the most affected region with 14 countries reporting cholera cases since the beginning of the year. The overall capacity to respond to the multiple and simultaneous outbreaks continues to be strained due to the global lack of resources, including shortages of the Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) and cholera supplies, as well as overstretched public health and medical personnel, who are dealing with multiple parallel disease outbreaks and other health emergencies. Based on the large number of outbreaks and their geographic expansion, as well as a lack of vaccines and other resources, WHO continues to assess the risk at global level as very high.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>Since the last situation report on the multi-country outbreak of cholera was published on 11 May 2023 (covering data reported until 18<sup>th</sup> of April), no new country reported a cholera outbreak. In total, 24 countries have reported cases since the beginning of 2023. Since the middle of April 2023, further geographic spread continues to be reported in the Horn of Africa, especially around the Mandera triangle, where borders of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia meet and population movement drives transmission across borders. The overall capacity to respond to the multiple and simultaneous outbreaks continues to be strained due to the global lack of resources, including shortages of the oral cholera vaccine, as well as overstretched public health and medical personnel, who are dealing with multiple disease outbreaks and other health emergencies at the same time. Based on the increasing number of outbreaks and their geographic expansion, as well as a lack of vaccines and other resources, WHO continues to assess the risk at global level as very high.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>Since the last&nbsp;situation report on the multi-country outbreak of cholera was published on 28 March 2023, one new country reported a cholera outbreak: Eswatini reported a first case in April, related to cross-border transmission from Mozambique and a second case without travel history. In total, 24 countries have reported cases since the beginning of 2023. Since the beginning of 2023, outbreaks have spread further across African regions. &nbsp;The overall capacity to respond to the multiple and simultaneous outbreaks continues to be strained due to the global lack of resources, including shortages of the oral cholera vaccine, as well as overstretched public health and medical personnel, who are dealing with multiple disease outbreaks and other health emergencies at the same time. Based on the current situation, WHO assesses the risk at the global level as very high.</p><p><em>Note: The number of suspected/confirmed cases for Zimbabwe were changed from 579 to 475 on 15 May 2023.</em></p>

Detections in 2022 were predominantly influenza A(H3N2). After the end of January 2023, activity increased again with a higher proportion of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B virus detections until a peak around week 10, after which detections have decreased.</li><li>In the countries of North America, most indicators of influenza activity were at levels typically observed towards the end of the season. Influenza A viruses predominated in the United States of America (USA), with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 accounting for the majority of subtyped viruses, whereas influenza B viruses predominated in Canada.</li><li>In Europe, overall influenza detections decreased and influenza positivity from sentinel sites decreased to 16% but remained above the epidemic threshold at the regional level. Out of 41 countries, 13 reported moderate intensity, with the remainder reporting low or below baseline intensity. Out of 40 countries, 20 continued to report widespread activity. Overall, influenza B viruses predominated in both sentinel and non-sentinel surveillance as all subregions experienced a wave of influenza B activity after an initial influenza A wave. Of the few influenza A viruses detected, the majority were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Influenza detections decreased or were stable in most countries except in Lithuania and Norway where very slight increases were reported. </li><li>In Central Asia, sporadic influenza detections were reported in Kazakhstan (influenza A(H1N1)pdm09) and Tajikistan (influenza B). </li><li>In Northern Africa, influenza detections were very low.</li><li>In Western Asia, influenza activity overall decreased but continued to be reported in some countries with detections of all seasonal influenza&nbsp;subtypes. </li><li>In East Asia, influenza activity continued to be driven predominantly by A(H1N1)pdm09 detections in China, which appeared to reach a peak and decrease slightly. Slight increases in some indicators of influenza activity were reported in China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), China and the Republic of Korea.</li><li>In the Caribbean and Central American countries, influenza activity of mainly influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses was low, although increases in influenza activity were reported in Belize and Guatemala where activity was close to the moderate threshold.</li><li>In&nbsp;the tropical countries of South America, influenza remained low with all seasonal subtypes detected and influenza B viruses predominant. Increasing trends in influenza activity and detections were reported in Brazil and Peru however activity remained low. In Bolivia (Plurinational State of), SARI activity remained high and RSV activity increased.</li><li>In tropical Africa, influenza activity increased in some countries of Western Africa while detections were low across reporting countries in Middle and Eastern Africa. </li><li>In Southern Asia, influenza activity remained low with influenza A(H3N2) and B/Victoria lineage viruses predominating.</li><li>In South-East Asia, influenza activity remained elevated mainly due to influenza B detections in Malaysia and influenza A(H3N2) in Singapore.</li><li>In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained low however influenza activity increased slightly in Chile and Australia. </li><li>Globally, RSV activity was generally low or decreasing except in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and a few countries in the Region of the Americas. RSV activity increased but remained below the seasonal threshold in parts of Australia and detections among hospitalized SARI patients increased in New Zealand.

Clinicians should consider influenza in differential diagnosis, especially for high-risk groups for influenza, and test and treat according to national guidance.</strong></li><li>Globally, influenza detections decreased steeply in January after a peak in late 2022. Detections in 2022 were predominantly influenza A(H3N2). Since the end of January 2023, activity increased again with an increased proportion of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B virus detections, and detections appear to have decreased in the most recent week. </li><li>In the countries of North America, most indicators of influenza activity were at levels typically observed towards the end of the season. Influenza A viruses predominated overall, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 accounting for the majority of subtyped influenza A viruses in the United States of America (USA), whereas influenza B viruses predominated in Canada.</li><li>In Europe, overall influenza detections decreased and influenza positivity from sentinel sites was stable and remained above the epidemic threshold at the regional level. Out of 37 countries, 16 reported medium intensity with the remainder reporting low or below baseline intensity. Eighteen of 36 countries reported widespread activity. Overall, influenza B viruses predominated in both sentinel and non-sentinel surveillance as all subregions experienced a wave of influenza B activity after an initial influenza A wave. Influenza detections decreased or were stable in most countries except in Denmark, Iceland, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Germany where slight increases were reported.</li><li>In&nbsp;Central Asia, influenza activity&nbsp;decreased.&nbsp;​</li><li>In Northern Africa, influenza detections were very low across reporting countries.</li><li>In Western Asia, influenza activity continued to be reported in some countries with detections of all seasonal influenza&nbsp;subtypes. </li><li>In East Asia, influenza activity of predominantly A(H1N1)pdm09 steeply increased in China but decreased in the other reporting countries. </li><li>In the Caribbean and Central American countries, influenza activity of mainly influenza B/Victoria lineage viruses remained low in most reporting countries. Increases in influenza activity were reported in Belize, El Salvador and Guatemala where activity increased to moderate levels.</li><li>In&nbsp;the tropical countries of South America, influenza remained low with all seasonal subtypes detected and influenza B viruses predominant. Slight increased trends in influenza activity and detections were reported in Bolivia (Plurinational State of) and Brazil.</li><li>In tropical Africa, influenza activity increased in some countries of Western Africa while detections were low across reporting countries in Middle and Eastern Africa. </li><li>In Southern Asia, influenza activity remained low with influenza A(H3N2) and B/Victoria lineage viruses predominant.</li><li>In South-East Asia, influenza activity remained elevated with influenza B mainly detected in Malaysia and A(H3N2) in Singapore and Thailand.</li><li>In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained low. </li><li>Globally, RSV activity was generally low or decreasing except in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. RSV activity increased but remained below the seasonal threshold in parts of Australia and detections among hospitalized SARI patients increased in New Zealand. In South Africa, the RSV season started in week 6 of 2023 and the detection rate among children under five years of age in pneumonia surveillance has reached a moderate level. RSV remained elevated in Brazil and Mexico.</li><li style="""">National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 115 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 06 March 2023 to 19 March 2023* (data as of 3/31/2023 6:38:27 AM UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 349&nbsp;552 specimens during that time period. 46&nbsp;911 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 34&nbsp;346 (73.22%) were typed as influenza A and 12&nbsp;565 (26.78%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 20&nbsp;264 (70.30%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 8560 (29.70%) were influenza A(H3N2).

<div></div><p>Since the last disease outbreak news on the global cholera situation was published on 11 February 2023, the global situation has further deteriorated with four new countries reporting outbreaks. In total, 24 countries are reporting cases as of 20 March. The overall capacity to respond to the multiple and simultaneous outbreaks continues to be strained due to the global lack of resources, including shortages of the oral cholera vaccine, as well as overstretched public health and medical personnel, who are dealing with multiple disease outbreaks and other health emergencies at the same time. Based on the current situation, WHO assesses the risk at the global level as very high.</p><p>Note: The headings in Table 1 were adjusted from <em>Total cases</em> to <em>Suspect/confirmed cases </em>for clarity.</p>

<p>As of 27 March 2023, two human cases of infection with avian influenza virus A(H5N1) virus have been confirmed in
Cambodia. On 23 February 2023, Cambodia reported to WHO one confirmed fatal case of human infection with avian
influenza A(H5N1) virus in a child. A second case, the father of the first case, was reported on 24 February 2023 and
had mild illness. Both cases had onset of illness on the same day, and both had exposure to sick and dead backyard
poultry. No further cases associated with this event or through other surveillance activities have been detected.

Influenza A viruses predominated with a slightly larger proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses detected among the subtyped influenza A viruses. The proportion of influenza B virus detections increased during this reporting period.</li><li>In the countries of North America, most indicators of influenza activity decreased to levels similar or below levels typically observed towards the end of the season. Influenza A viruses predominated and influenza A(H3N2) accounted for the majority of subtyped influenza A viruses in the United States of America (USA), whereas A(H1N1)pdm09 accounted for the majority of subtyped influenza A viruses in Canada.</li><li>In Europe, overall influenza detections remained stable and influenza positivity from sentinel sites increased in the most recent week, remaining above the epidemic threshold at the regional level. Out of 39 countries, 18 reported high or moderate intensity, and over half continued to report widespread activity. Overall, influenza A and B viruses were detected at similar proportions in both sentinel and non-sentinel surveillance. The proportion of influenza B viruses increased in recent weeks.

The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 452 053 specimens during that time period. 31912 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 18760 (58.8%) were typed as influenza A and 13152 (41.2%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 4159 (66.2%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 2144 (33.8%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 100% (1094) belonged to the B/Victoria lineage. </li></ul><img src=""/images/default-source/departments/global-influenza-programme/biweekly-map-2023-7.png?sfvrsn=92b02f14_3"" alt="""" sf-size=""100""><ul><li><span style=""background-color:transparent;font-family:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;font-size:inherit;"">SARS-CoV-2 positivity from sentinel surveillance remained around 20% globally.

<h3>Overview </h3>
<ul><li>The Greater Horn of Africa (GHoA) countries are facing a
serious food insecurity crisis due to failed rainy seasons as
well as flooding in other areas and various other factors.
</li><li>The ongoing climate crisis, pre-existing conflicts, and
global inflation have put more than 46 million people at risk
of acute food insecurity.
</li><li>Somalia reports 300 cases of cholera a week, three times
more than previous two Decembers. Kenya experiences a
severe outbreak of cholera, with 3,306 cases since October,
whereas cases in Ethiopia increased by 30% in December
compared to the month before.
</li><li>Although measles vaccination campaigns are
implemented, large outbreaks in multiple areas remain
prevalent across all seven GHoA countries.
</li><li>An estimated 8.3 million people (48% of the total
population assessed) across Somalia are expected to face
IPC Phase 3+ food insecurity between April and June 2023,
</li><li>The total estimated acute malnutrition burden in Somalia
is expected to reach approximately 1.8 million children,
through July 2023.
</li><li>Due to the poor harvest season in Uganda and reduced
rains, it is projected that the region is likely to experience a
resurgence of high acute malnutrition cases.
</li><li>The drought situation in Kenya remains critical in 22 of the
23 arid and semi-arid counties due to the late onset and poor performance of the October - December 2022 short rains.
</li><li>WHO continues to provide support by coordinating the efforts of health sector partners, in addition scaling up its
assistance to the seven countries to enable them to detect and respond to disease outbreaks. WHO has also deployed
funds, personnel, technical expertise and supplies.
</li><li>Various donors maintain the provision of financial support. However, as of 31 December, only 43% of the USD123.8
million WHO appeal for 2022 has been funded. A total of US$ 165.3 million is pledged in the outbreak and crisis
response appeal for the Greater of Horn in 2023 [1]. Sustained humanitarian assistance will be essential to address the
needs beyond 2022, and a rapid identification of additional funding and resources is needed to mitigate unprecedented
morbidity and mortality.</li></ul>

</li><li>Globally, influenza activity remained elevated due to activity in the northern hemisphere. &nbsp;Where subtyped, influenza A viruses predominated with a slightly larger proportion of A(H3N2) viruses detected among the subtyped influenza A viruses.
</li><li>In the countries of North America, most indicators of influenza activity decreased while others&nbsp;were&nbsp;stable or continued to&nbsp;increase. Many indicators were at, or above, levels typically observed at this time of year, and some were near
or above&nbsp;levels observed at the peak of previous severe epidemics. Influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant virus detected.</li><li>In Europe, overall influenza activity continued to increase with influenza positivity from sentinel sites remaining above the epidemic threshold at the regional level. Overall, influenza A viruses predominated with A(H3N2) viruses accounting for the
majority of subtyped influenza viruses from primary care sentinel sites but with regional differences. Half of reporting countries signalled high or very high intensity. In central Asia, influenza activity increased with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09
viruses predominant followed by influenza B viruses. </li><li>In Northern Africa, influenza detections increased among reporting countries with all seasonal subtypes detected. </li><li>In Western Asia, influenza activity decreased overall with all seasonal influenza&nbsp;subtypes detected, though increased activity was&nbsp;reported in some countries. </li><li>In East Asia, influenza activity of predominantly influenza A(H3N2) viruses remained low overall&nbsp;among reporting countries but with increases reported in Mongolia and the&nbsp;Republic of Korea.&nbsp;</li><li>In the Caribbean and Central American countries, influenza activity of predominantly influenza A(H3N2) viruses decreased overall but remained elevated in Mexico. </li><li>In&nbsp;the tropical countries of South America, influenza detections were generally low, and A(H3N2) viruses predominated. Influenza positivity was at a moderate level in Ecuador. </li><li>In tropical Africa, influenza activity remained low with detections of all seasonal influenza subtypes reported. Activity increased in some countries in Eastern Africa.</li><li>In Southern Asia, influenza activity remained at a low level, mainly due to decreased activity reported in Iran (Islamic Republic of). Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the most frequently detected subtype in the subregion.</li><li>In South-East Asia, detections of predominantly influenza B remained elevated due to continued detections reported in Malaysia.</li><li>In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity decreased in Argentina and Chile to low levels and remained low elsewhere.</li><li>National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 131 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 12 December 2022 to 25 December 2022* (data as of 2023-01-06 02:10:00 UTC).

GISRS laboratories tested more than 604&nbsp;408 specimens during that time period. 121&nbsp;935 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 117&nbsp;840 (96.6%) were typed as influenza A and 4095 (3.4%) as influenza B. Of the subtyped influenza
A viruses, 10&nbsp;108 (43.5%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 13&nbsp;123 (56.5%) were influenza A(H3N2).

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>During 2020, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses arose from previously
circulating A(H5Nx) viruses and spread predominantly via migratory birds to many parts of Africa, Asia and Europe.
The epizootic has led to unprecedented numbers of deaths in wild birds and caused outbreaks in domestic poultry.
In late 2021, these viruses crossed to North America and subsequently South America in the autumn of 2022.
Additionally, there has been an increased spill over to non-avian species including wild terrestrial and marine
mammals and, more recently, the detection of an outbreak in a mink farm in Spain. From 2020 to date, six human
cases of influenza A(H5N1) belonging to the 2.3.4.4b clade were reported to WHO.
The majority of the influenza A(H5N1) HPAI characterized genetically since 2020 related to these outbreaks are
belonging to the 2.3.4.4b clade. This risk assessment focuses on the most recent A(H5N1) viruses belonging to the
2.3.4.4b clade.</p>

<h3>Overview </h3>
<ul><li>&nbsp;The humanitarian crisis in the Greater Horn of Africa (GHoA)
continues as a large part of the region is battling the worst drought
in at least 40 years, while other parts face flooding and conflict. </li><li>In the Horn of Africa, a 5th consecutive season of drought has been
set in motion by a poor start of the October - December rainy season,
and below-average rainfall is also considered likely to continue
during the March - May 2023 season. </li><li>Immediate global action is required to prevent the highest level of
food insecurity in the GHoA. More than 46 people million are
estimated to be food insecure in the GHoA and out of those more
than 361,000 people are facing IPC phase 5 (Somalia and Kenya). </li><li>Rapidly rising numbers of both severe and moderate acute
malnutrition admissions are recorded into nutrition programs; a
dramatic increase compared to previous years. </li><li>Analysis of the seven countries in the GHoA recorded 39 reported
outbreaks, flooding and other acute public health events between
1 January and 30 October 2022. </li><li>Numerous disease outbreaks are continuing or newly reported,
with multiple countries dealing with active measles and cholera outbreaks. </li><li>Other outbreaks of concern include mpox (monkeypox), anthrax, dengue, Sudan Ebola Virus (SUDV) and hepatitis E.
Countries are conducting vaccination campaigns to control outbreaks. Elevated caseloads of malaria are reported in
areas with above average rainfall in various countries. </li><li>Although vaccination coverage for children under 5 years is not optimal in many areas of the GHoA, countries are
making an intensified effort to scale up population immunization through routine administration and additional

Clinicians should consider influenza in differential diagnosis, especially for high-risk groups for influenza, and test and treat according to national guidance.</strong></li><li>Globally, influenza activity remained low and where subtyped, influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated. An increasing trend of influenza activity was observed in the northern hemisphere while a plateau was observed in the southern hemisphere.</li><li>In the countries of North America, influenza activity increased slightly in recent weeks. Influenza A(H3N2) was predominant among the few subtyped viruses.</li><li>In Europe, overall influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels, with a low but increasing trend. Influenza A viruses predominated among the reported detections in general with A(H3N2) viruses accounting for the majority of subtyped influenza A viruses.</li><li>In central Asia, Kazakhstan reported increased influenza activity with B/Victoria-lineage viruses predominating.</li><li>In East Asia, influenza activity of predominantly influenza A(H3N2) remained stable, at low levels, overall. ​</li><li>In Western Asia influenza activity was elevated. Detections of influenza continued to increase in some countries of the Arab Peninsula.</li><li>In the Caribbean and Central American countries, low influenza activity was reported with influenza A(H3N2) most frequently detected. </li><li>In&nbsp;the tropical countries of South America, influenza detections were low and A(H3N2) detections predominated.</li><li>In tropical Africa, influenza activity remained low with detections of influenza A(H3N2), B/Victoria and A(H1N1)pdm09 reported .</li><li>In Southern Asia, influenza activity remained low, with the exception of Iran (Islamic Republic of) where increased activity was reported. The majority of subtyped detections were influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09, with few influenza B detections. </li><li>In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, overall influenza activity appeared to further decrease this reporting period, except in temperate South America where activity increased in some countries.</li><li>In Oceania, influenza activity remained low with detections of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) and some B viruses in Australia. ILI activity in New Zealand and, in general, across the Pacific Islands remained low except in a few countries.</li><li>In Southern Africa, influenza detections decreased. Influenza B/Victoria viruses predominated, with some influenza A(H3N2) and only very few influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detections.</li><li>In temperate South America, influenza detections have continued to increase in Argentina and Chile. Elsewhere, influenza activity remained low or below the seasonal threshold. Influenza A viruses predominated with A(H1N1)pdm09 predominant among subtyped viruses in Argentina and other countries reporting mostly A(H3N2) viruses.&nbsp;</li><li>National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 113 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 03 October 2022 to 16 October 2022* (data as of 10/28/2022 7:17:42 AM UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 311623 specimens during that time period. 13035 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 11782 (90.39%) were typed as influenza A and 1278 (9.80%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 872 (18.05%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 3958 (81.95%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, all 423 were of the B/Victoria lineage.&nbsp; <img src=""/images/default-source/departments/global-influenza-programme/biweekly/2022_10_31_surveillance_update_431.png?sfvrsn=e1caaccc_3"" alt="""" sf-size=""1457077""></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>COVID-19 positivity from sentinel surveillance increased above 10% during the latest week of reporting, after a long-term downtrend beginning in mid-2022.

Health risks increase while access to healthcare is restricted. A significant increase in global and severe acute malnutrition among children in many internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugee settings has been recorded. Communicable diseases, including cholera, measles, yellow fever, and COVID-19 are a major public health concern, especially with the further displacements and disruption of living conditions and sanitation.</span></p><p>There are several threats that cause IDPs and refugees to flee their homes. Some reasons for fleeing are to escape violence, conflict(s), human right&nbsp;violations, and other man-made or natural threats. States must protect the rights of IDPs, however, some states are unable or unwilling to do so, leaving IDPs and refugees facing food insecurity as well as threats to their health and well-being1. Additionally, there is an evident inversed relationship as well, where food insecurity by itself can be a major contributing factor to becoming displaced.</p><p>Refugees and IDPs are among the groups most vulnerable to acute food insecurity and malnutrition as well as other health risks resulting from the loss of assets and means of subsistence, disruptions to community-based safety nets, and disruptions to national social protection systems. At the same time, barriers to healthcare access also increase, reducing the coverage of affordable, available, and accessible healthcare services, threatening the effectiveness of health programs.</p><p></p><p></p>

**摘要**

埃塞俄比亚、肯尼亚、索马里和吉布提的粮食安全和营养状况持续恶化，原因是持续的干旱、冲突以及新冠疫情的经济影响。预计情况将继续恶化，大约 810 万人正面临紧急粮食不安全（IPC 第 3 或第 4 阶段），其中包括约 480 万严重粮食不安全（IPC 第 4 阶段）的人。

**持续的干旱**

持续的干旱是该地区粮食不安全的主要原因。2022 年 3 月至 5 月期间的季风降雨低于平均水平，目前正在经历的 10 月至 12 月的雨季预计也会低于平均水平。缺乏降雨正在损害作物生产，导致牲畜瘦弱和死亡，并减少水的供应。埃塞俄比亚、肯尼亚和索马里的许多地区已经经历了三个或更多的连续降雨不足的雨季。

**冲突**

冲突加剧了该地区的粮食不安全。埃塞俄比亚北部持续的冲突造成人员流离失所和生计中断，数百万人急需援助。索马里的冲突和暴力活动也加剧了粮食不安全，对获取食物和生计机会构成了挑战。

**新冠疫情**

新冠疫情对该地区的粮食安全产生了重大影响。疫情导致经济中断、失业和收入减少，使许多家庭难以获得足够的食物。封锁措施和旅行限制也中断了食品供应链，导致价格上涨。

**健康影响**

粮食不安全与大量健康问题有关，包括急性营养不良、发育迟缓和贫血。对于免疫力低下的人群，如儿童、孕妇和老年人，粮食不安全可能尤其危险。

**应对措施**

该地区正在采取多种措施来应对粮食不安全和健康状况。这些措施包括：

* 分发粮食援助
* 提供营养支持
* 改善水和环境卫生条件
* 提供牲畜饲料和兽医服务
* 促进生计建设
* 加强冲突地区的安全

**资金需求**

为了满足该地区的需求，急需资金。联合国世界粮食计划署等援助机构已呼吁提供资金，以提供粮食援助、营养支持和其他救生援助。

**结论**

非洲之角的粮食安全和健康状况持续恶化，需要紧急行动。该地区正在采取多种措施来应对危机，但急需资金来支持这些措施。如果不采取行动，粮食不安全和相关健康问题的后果可能会很严重。","

**肯尼亚**

• 肯尼亚 13 个县连续三个雨季降水不足，导致农业严重受损和农牧业活动中断，超过 190 万人面临严重粮食不安全。
• 莱基皮亚郡的 Nyahururu 和 Nyandarua 郡的 Ol Kalou 报告出现营养不良和饥荒相关死亡病例。
• 政府已宣布为干旱灾区提供 50 亿肯尼亚先令（4900 万美元）的补充资金。


**埃塞俄比亚**

• 埃塞俄比亚受干旱影响的地区至少有 10 个地区，包括奥罗米亚州的干旱状况最严重。
• 预计埃塞俄比亚 2022 年 9 月的粮食安全阶段综合分类表（IPC）分析将显示 2000 万人面临粮食危机或更严重的后果。
• 政府已经制定了一项紧急粮食安全响应计划，为受影响民众提供 33 万吨粮食援助。


**索马里**

• 索马里持续的干旱影响了 860 万人，其中 710 万人面临严重的粮食不安全。
• 索马里 11 个州中有 8 个州处于严重粮食不安全阶段。
• 索马里政府已拨款 1000 万美元支持应对干旱行动，还宣布打算在旱情最严重的地区建立 10 个流动救济服务中心。


**吉布提**

• 干旱已经导致吉布提 50 万人口中的约 20 万人口面临严重粮食不安全。
• 吉布提政府正在努力为受影响民众提供紧急救济，包括食品援助、营养治疗和水源运输。


**背景**

• 肯尼亚、埃塞俄比亚、索马里和吉布提自 2020 年以来一直遭受连续的旱情。
• 这种情况是由印度洋偶极子（IOD）现象异常造成的，该现象导致非洲东部和南部地区的降水量很少。
• 预计未来几个月干旱将持续，这将对受影响地区人民的粮食安全和营养状况产生进一步影响。
• 2022 年 9 月的 IPC 分析将提供有关受旱情影响地区粮食安全和营养状况的最新信息。","

**摘要**

在随后的第六个歉收季节之后，肯尼亚、埃塞俄比亚和索马里预计将进入 70 年来最严重的干旱。预计从 2022 年 9 月到 2023 年 3 月的雨季可能会低于平均水平，导致大非洲之角的粮食安全持续恶化。

**受影响的人口的规模和分布**

* 肯尼亚：220 万流离失所者，290 万极度粮食不安全者
* 埃塞俄比亚：610 万流离失所者，2000 万极度粮食不安全者
* 索马里：110 万流离失所者，600 万极度粮食不安全者

**粮食安全状况**

* 在大非洲之角，670 万儿童严重营养不良，超过 3000 万人面临严重的粮食不安全（综合粮食安全阶段分类 3 级或更糟）。
* 预计到 2022 年 10 月，严重粮食不安全的人口将增加到超过 4000 万，其中包括肯尼亚的 360 万人、埃塞俄比亚的 2200 万人和索马里的 410 万人。

**营养不良和疾病**

* 随着粮食不安全状况恶化，营养不良率预计将持续上升。特别令人担忧的是儿童，他们更容易受到营养不良的影响。
* 传染病的风险也会增加，因为营养不良会削弱免疫系统。

**应对措施**

* 人道组织正在采取措施应对危机，包括提供粮食援助、治疗营养不良儿童和防止疾病爆发。
* 然而，迫切需要更多的资金来扩大援助规模并防止大规模饥荒。

**对策**

* 扩大粮食援助
* 治疗营养不良
* 预防疾病爆发
* 提高社区的复原力

","**情势报告：非洲之角大旱和粮食不安全——2022 年 8 月 28 日**

**突发事件概况**

自 2020 年起，非洲之角一直遭受严重旱灾，受影响的人口已达 2300万，其中包括 580万被迫迁离家园流离失所者。 2022 年 9 月，埃塞俄比亚、肯尼亚和索马里（合称“非洲之角”）已连续第六个季节降水低于平均水平，预计 7 月至 12 月期间仍将如此 [1] 。这一旱灾是 40 年来最严重的。

除旱灾之外，持续的冲突、蝗灾、新冠疫情和经济衰退等因素也加剧了该地区粮食不安全状况。

**粮食安全状况**

在非洲之角，饥荒迫在眉睫。预计 2023 年 8 月以前，索马里部分地区将出现大面积饥荒。此外，埃塞俄比亚和肯尼亚的粮食不安全状况也日益恶化。

非洲之角有 2200 万人处于严重粮食不安全状态（5 级综合粮食安全阶段分类 (IPC)），其中包括 200 万儿童。超过 700 万儿童营养不良，其中 2 岁以下儿童中 150 万人严重营养不良。

**人道主义需求**

非洲之角急需人道主义援助，包括食品、水、营养、医疗保健和住所。

联合国人道主义事务协调厅 (OCHA) 呼吁提供 14 亿美金，以应对该地区的危机。截至目前，仅获得 49% 的资金。

**人道主义行动**

人道主义组织正在努力为非洲之角受影响民众提供援助。他们正在提供食品、现金援助、营养补充剂、医疗保健、住房和保护服务。

世界粮食计划署 (WFP) 是非洲之角最大的粮食援助提供者。 2022 年，WFP 为该地区 1100 万人提供了粮食援助。

**展望**

非洲之角的旱情和粮食不安全状况预计在未来几个月将继续恶化。人道主义组织需要立即获得更多资金，以挽救生命和防止饥荒。

Others are using up essential resources to support a limited diet.</li><li>While providing food and safe water is a high priority, ensuring a strong health response to the emergency is needed to prevent morbidity and mortality.&nbsp;</li><li>Rising food insecurity contributes to increased health risks and needs: In the areas affected by food insecurity, outbreaks of communicable diseases are a major public health concern at present, especially considering the often low immunization rates&nbsp;</li><li>In the many of the affected areas, safe drinking water is scarce with increased risk of water borne diseases. As people move to find water, food and pasture for their animals, living conditions and sanitation of the community will likely decrease, further contributing to health risks.</li><li>Loss of livelihood and food insecurity are also contributing to increased risky behavior to obtain the resources that are needed, while violence over scarce commodities increases the risk of trauma and injury.&nbsp;</li><li>WHO is coordinating the health sector to ramp up its response to avert the worst effects of food insecurity and to give people access to the health services they need. Along with countering the consequences of malnutrition, WHO is helping countries to prepare for and respond to outbreaks of diseases like cholera, measles, and malaria.<br></li></ul>Download full report on the left.

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>The Chinese health authority reported an influenza A(H3N8) infection in a 4-year-old boy from Henan Province on 25 April 2022 to the World Health Organization (WHO). No human infection with influenza A(H3N8) virus had been recorded before this case. Genetic analysis of the virus confirmed it is of avian origin. Avian influenza A(H3N8) viruses are commonly found - but not associated with disease - in wild birds; such viruses have also been detected in live poultry markets in Asia. Occasionally, A(H3N8) viruses have been associated with disease in dogs, horses, pigs, donkeys, and most recently seals. However, the genetic composition of A(H3N8) viruses detected in animals to date is different from that detected in the patient.</p>

Various hygiene and physical distancing measures implemented by Member States to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission have likely played a role in reducing influenza virus transmission.</li><li>Globally, influenza activity remained low, but activity has increased since February 2022 after an initial decrease in January 2022.</li><li><strong>With the increasing detections of influenza during COVID-19 pandemic, countries are recommended to prepare for co-circulation of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 </strong><strong>viruses</strong><strong>.

Various hygiene and physical distancing measures implemented by Member States to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission have likely played a role in reducing influenza virus transmission.</li><li>Globally, influenza activity remained low in comparison with pre-COVID years, but activity has increased again since February 2022 after an initial decrease in January 2022.</li><li><strong>With the increasing detections of influenza during COVID-19 pandemic, countries are recommended to prepare for co-circulation of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 </strong><strong>viruses</strong><strong>.

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>Between the end of January and early March 2022, there was a consistent decreasing trend in the number of new COVID-19 cases, which was followed by two consecutive weeks of increase in cases. During the week of 21 through 27 March 2022, the number of new cases declined again with a 14% decrease as compared to the previous week. On the other hand, during the same period, the number of new weekly deaths has increased by 43%, driven by changes in the definition of COVID-19 deaths in countries in the Region of the Americas (Chile and the United States of America) and retrospective adjustments reported from India in the South-East Asia Region.</p><p>Across the six WHO regions, over 10 million new cases and over 45 000 new deaths were reported. All regions reported decreasing trends in the number of new weekly cases and four regions reported a decreasing trend in new weekly deaths. As of 27 March 2022, over 479 million confirmed cases and over 6 million deaths have been reported globally.</p><p>In this edition, we provide updates on the geographic distribution of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), including information on recombinant variants.</p>

Various hygiene and physical distancing measures implemented by Member States to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission have likely played a role in reducing influenza virus transmission.&nbsp;</li><li>Globally, influenza activity remained low and appeared to decrease. In some countries influenza activity reached the levels seen this time of year in pre-COVID-19 period.</li><li><strong>With the increasing detections of influenza during COVID-19 pandemic, countries are recommended to prepare for co-circulation of influenza and SARS-CoV-2.

Influenza detections remained low compared to similar periods in past seasons (except 2020-2021). RSV activity continued to decrease in the USA and Canada.</li><li>In Europe, influenza activity appeared to decrease. Influenza A(H3N2) predominated.</li><li>In East Asia, influenza activity continued on an increasing trend in China, while influenza illness indicators and activity remained low in the rest of the subregion. Influenza B-Victoria lineage viruses predominated.</li><li>In Western Asia and Northern Africa, continuous influenza transmission has been reported in some countries.</li><li>In the Caribbean and Central American countries, some influenza activity was reported with influenza A(H3N2) predominating.</li><li>In tropical South America, influenza A(H3N2) detections remained elevated.

Various hygiene and physical distancing measures implemented by Member States to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission have likely played a role in reducing influenza virus transmission.&nbsp;</li><li>Globally, influenza activity remains low but continued to increase especially in the temperate zones of the northern hemisphere. In several countries influenza activity reached the levels seen this time of year in pre-COVID-19 period.</li><li><strong></strong><strong>With the increasing detections of influenza during COVID-19 pandemic, countries are recommended to prepare for co-circulation of influenza and SARS-CoV-2.

RSV activity decreased in the USA and Canada.</li><li>In Europe, influenza activity continued to increase. Influenza A(H3N2) predominated.</li><li>In East Asia, influenza activity continued on an increasing trend in China, while influenza illness indicators and activity remained low in the rest of the subregion. Influenza B-Victoria lineage viruses predominated.</li><li>In the Caribbean and Central American countries, influenza A(H3N2) and B virus detections increased in some countries.&nbsp;</li><li>In tropical South America, influenza A(H3N2) detections increased overall. Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) levels were reported at extraordinary levels in Bolivia (Plurinational State).&nbsp;</li><li>In tropical Africa, overall influenza activity continued on a decreasing trend, with both influenza A and B detected.&nbsp;</li><li>In Southern Asia, influenza virus detections of predominately influenza A(H3N2) increased overall, although decreasing in a few countries.&nbsp;</li><li>In South-East Asia, sporadic influenza detections were reported in the Philippines.</li><li>In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained low overall, although increased detections of influenza A(H3N2) were reported in temperate South America.</li><li>National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 110 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 6 December 2021 to 26 December 2021* (data as of 2022-01-07 11:00:29 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 522595 specimens during that time period. A total of 27153 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 19980 (73.6%) were typed as influenza A and 7173 (26.4%) as influenza B.

<p>The global number of new cases has been increasing for the last 2 months with over 4.4 million cases reported in the past week (9 – 15 August 2021), bringing the cumulative number of globally to cases to over 206 million. This increasing trend is largely attributed to increases in the Western Pacific Region and the Region of the Americas which reported 14% and 8% increases respectively as compared to the previous week. Overall, the number of deaths reported remained similar with over 66 000 deaths this week, as compared to the previous week. While the African Region reported the largest percentage decrease in case and death incidence, 23% and 18% respectively, data from the weekend is incomplete which might lead to an overestimation of the percentage change.

**病毒变体**

自疫情开始以来，新冠病毒不断发生变异。目前正在监测多个变体，包括阿尔法变异体 (B.1.1.7)、贝塔变异体 (B.1.351)、伽马变异体 (P.1) 和德尔塔变异体 (B.1.617.2)。

这些变体更具传染性，并且可能导致更严重的疾病。目前尚不清楚这些变体的疫苗有效性如何。

**疫情应对**

应对新冠病毒疫情的措施包括：

* **监测和检测：**监测和检测新冠病毒感染病例，以便采取适当的控制措施。
* **隔离和治疗：**将感染者与其他人隔离并提供适当的治疗，以防止病毒传播。
* **旅行限制：**限制或禁止旅行以防止病毒传播。
* **社交距离：**保持社交距离以减少病毒传播。
* **个人防护设备 (PPE)：**使用个人防护设备，如口罩和手套，以减少病毒传播。
* **疫苗接种：**开发和部署新冠病毒疫苗是应对疫情的关键措施。

**结论**

新冠病毒疫情仍在继续，每周报告超过 500 万例新感染病例。欧洲仍然是感染和死亡病例最多的区域，其次是美洲。疫情应对措施包括监测和检测、隔离和治疗、旅行限制、社交距离、个人防护设备和疫苗接种。",,,2021-04-27,,"[""美国""]",,https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---27-april-2021,who_situation_reports,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20210427_weekly_epi_update_37.pdf?sfvrsn=a1ab459c_9&download=true,,,,,"[""新型冠状病毒感染""]",,,,,,,,,,2023-12-21 02:20:54,2024-06-30 15:34:27,,,"{""hasDeath"": true, ""affectedPopulationType"": ""人类""}",2024-06-30 15:34:27

**前言**

在 1 月 20 日宣布首例新冠病毒病例 14 个月后，阿根廷报告了首例 mpox 确诊病例。值得注意的是，意大利首次报告了 mpox 病例，该病例在 5 月 6 日已得到确认 [2]。此外，据报道，葡萄牙于 5 月 19 日记录了首例病例 [3]。

**流行病学**

截至 4 月 5 日，阿根廷已确认 22 例 mpox 病例，其中 21 例来自布宜诺斯艾利斯市，1 例来自布宜诺斯艾利斯省。根据确认的病例，该疾病主要是同性恋男性的性传播。然而，阿根廷目前尚未报告任何相关死亡病例。

**病毒的特性**

猴痘病毒是一种正痘病毒科病毒，在西非和中非地区流行，猴痘病毒有两种主要遗传分支，即刚果盆地（中非）分支和西非分支。

感染猴痘病毒的症状类似于天花，但症状较轻。症状通常持续 2-4 周，按照发病阶段可分为以下几类 [4]：

* **侵袭期**（0-5 天）：发热、强烈头痛、淋巴结肿大、肌肉痛、无力和疲劳。
* **皮疹病期**（1-3 天）：皮疹从面部开始，逐渐扩散到身体的其他部位。皮疹会经历不同的阶段，从斑丘疹到水疱、脓疱和结痂。
* **康复期**（2-3 周）：结痂脱落，不留疤痕。

猴痘病毒通过密切接触受感染动物或人的体液传播。在人与人之间，病毒主要通过飞沫和长时间面对面接触传播。值得注意的是，该病毒还可以通过与受污染的物品接触而传播。

**预防和控制措施**

与其他病毒性疾病一样，猴痘病毒的预防和控制基于以下关键措施 [1]：

* 加强监测和疾病监测系统，以便及早发现和报告病例。
* 对病例进行隔离，并对其密切接触者进行追踪和监测。
* 加强对医疗保健工作者和社区的风险沟通和教育，以提高对猴痘病毒及其传播方式的认识。
* 确保提供足够的个人防护设备 (PPE) 以预防和控制感染。
* 促进定期洗手、呼吸卫生以及避免与患病动物或人在同个环境中接触。

**疫苗接种**

目前，还没有针对猴痘病毒的具体疫苗。然而，天花疫苗对猴痘病毒有 85% 的交叉保护作用 [6]。因此，建议对医疗保健工作者和高危人群进行天花疫苗接种。

**治疗**

目前，还没有针对猴痘病毒的具体治疗方法。治疗方法侧重于缓解症状和预防并发症。根据症状的严重程度，治疗可能包括：

* 对症治疗，如退热药和止痛药。
* 抗病毒药物，如 cidofovir 和 tecovirimat。
* 静脉补液，用于预防脱水。
* 抗生素，用于治疗继发性细菌感染。

**结论**

对于猴痘病毒，重要的是采取预防和控制措施，以便在阿根廷及其他国家防止疾病的传播。通过加强监测、提高认识、适当进行疫苗接种和采取适当的治疗措施，我们可以有效控制猴痘病毒的传播，并最大限度地减少其对公共卫生的影响。

in Member States. The various hygiene and physical distancing measures implemented by Member States to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission have likely played a role in reducing influenza virus transmission. </li><li>Globally, despite continued or even increased testing for influenza in some countries, influenza activity remained at lower levels than expected for this time of the year. </li><li>In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity remained below inter-seasonal levels, though sporadic detections of influenza A and B viruses were reported in some countries.
</li><li>In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity was reported at inter-seasonal level.</li><li>In the Caribbean and Central American countries, influenza activity of predominately B/Victoria viruses was reported in Haiti in recent weeks. Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) activity, likely due to COVID-19, decreased in most reporting
countries.
</li><li>In tropical South America, there were no influenza detections across reporting countries.</li><li>In tropical Africa, influenza activity was reported in some countries of Western Africa.</li><li>In Southern Asia, influenza detections continued to be reported in Afghanistan and India. </li><li>In South East Asia, influenza detections of predominately influenza A(H3N2) continued to be reported in Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Thailand and Viet Nam.</li><li>Worldwide, of the very low numbers of detections reported, seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses accounted for the majority of detections. </li></ul><p>National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 102 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 26 October 2020 to 08 November 2020 <em>(data as of 2020-11-20 03:28:24 UTC)</em>.The
WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 108638<sup>1</sup> specimens during that time period. A total of 100 specimens were positive for influenza viruses, of which 63 (63%) were typed as influenza A and 37 (37%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza

/information-for-travellers-visiting-countries-with-zika-virus-transmission,Information for travellers visiting countries with Zika virus transmission,为前往寨卡病毒传播国家的旅行者提供的信息,"
<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>Zika virus is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of infected&nbsp;<em>Aedes</em>&nbsp;mosquitoes, which bite predominantly during the day and early evening. Zika virus can also be transmitted through sex and during pregnancy from mother to foetus.&nbsp;<em>Aedes</em>&nbsp;mosquitoes also transmit dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and other viruses. These mosquito-transmitted viruses often circulate in the same geographic areas.</p><p>Based on available evidence, WHO advises against any restriction of travel to or trade with countries, areas and territories with Zika virus transmission. However, WHO recommends that pregnant women avoid travel to areas with Zika virus transmission, particularly during outbreaks, based on the increased risk of microcephaly and other severe congenital malformations in infants born to women infected with Zika virus during pregnancy.</p><p>As a precautionary measure, some national governments may make public health and travel recommendations to their own populations, based on their assessment of the available evidence and local risk factors.</p><h3>Before travelling to areas with potential Zika virus transmission</h3><p>Some areas of the world continue to experience Zika virus outbreaks or ongoing transmission. Other areas have had evidence of prior Zika virus transmission but no recent evidence of transmission, and some have sporadic reported cases or low levels of transmission. Risk of infection may vary in different areas within a country, may vary seasonally, and likely changes over time. Most Zika virus infections have no symptoms or have mild, non-specific symptoms, that may elude detection or reporting. In the absence of large outbreaks, accurate and up-to-date information on risk of Zika virus transmission is therefore limited in many countries and territories. Lack of detection or reporting of Zika virus transmission, therefore, cannot necessarily be equated with evidence that transmission is not occurring.</p><p>WHO remains committed to strengthening public health systems for early detection and response to emergence, re-emergence, and global spread of Zika virus infection and its complications.

","<h3>概述</h3><p>寨卡病毒主要通过受感染的<em>伊蚊</em>叮咬传播给人类，伊蚊主要在白天和傍晚叮咬。寨卡病毒还可以通过性行为和怀孕期间从母亲传播给胎儿。<em>伊蚊</em>还传播登革热、基孔肯雅热、黄热病和其他病毒。这些由蚊子传播的病毒通常在同一地理区域传播。</p><p>根据现有证据，世卫组织建议不要限制前往存在寨卡病毒传播的国家、地区和领土的旅行或贸易。然而，世卫组织建议孕妇避免前往寨卡病毒传播地区，特别是在寨卡病毒爆发期间，因为怀孕期间感染寨卡病毒的妇女所生婴儿出现小头畸形和其他严重先天畸形的风险增加。</p><p>作为预防措施，一些国家政府可能会根据对现有证据和当地风险因素的评估，向本国民众提出公共卫生和旅行建议。</p><h3>在前往可能传播寨卡病毒的地区之前</h3><p>世界一些地区继续经历寨卡病毒爆发或持续传播。其他地区有过寨卡病毒先前传播的证据，但最近没有传播证据，有些地区报告了零星病例或传播程度较低。一个国家内不同地区的感染风险可能会有所不同，可能会随季节变化，并且可能会随着时间的推移而变化。大多数寨卡病毒感染没有症状或有轻微的非特异性症状，可能会逃避检测或报告。因此，在没有大规模疫情爆发的情况下，许多国家和地区关于寨卡病毒传播风险的准确和最新信息有限。因此，缺乏对寨卡病毒传播的检测或报告并不一定等同于没有发生传播的证据。</p><p>世卫组织仍然致力于加强公共卫生系统，以便及早发现并应对寨卡病毒感染及其并发症的出现、再次出现和全球传播。世卫组织将定期更新寨卡病毒传播和疫情的流行病学信息，向各国、医疗保健提供者和旅行者提供信息。</p><ul><li><a href=""/publications/m/item/zika-epidemiology-update"">寨卡流行病学更新</a><br>2019年7月</li></ul><p>世卫组织建议孕妇、可能在旅行后两个月内怀孕的女性以及其伴侣可能在旅行后三个月内怀孕的男性旅行者在前往相关地区之前向其医疗保健提供者咨询，并仔细考虑寨卡感染的风险和可能的后果可能存在寨卡病毒传播的地方。</p><ul><li><a href=""/publications-detail-redirect/9789241550482"">世界卫生组织预防寨卡病毒性传播指南</a></li></ul><h3>在可能传播寨卡病毒以及伊蚊和其他日间叮咬蚊子传播的其他疾病的地区</h3><p>所有旅行者都应采取适当措施，减少白天和傍晚接触蚊虫叮咬的可能性，并避免寨卡病毒的性传播风险。</p><p>为了防止白天和傍晚进食的蚊子叮咬，建议旅客：</p><ul><li>穿尽可能遮盖身体的衣服——最好是浅色的；</li><li>使用含有 DEET（二乙基甲苯酰胺）、IR 3535（（3-[N-丁基-N-乙酰基]，氨基丙酸乙酯）或 KBR3023（也称为埃卡瑞丁或派卡瑞丁）的驱虫剂。驱虫剂可用于暴露的皮肤或涂在衣服上，必须严格按照标签说明使用。如果驱虫剂和防晒霜同时使用，应先涂防晒霜，后涂驱虫剂；</li><li>在门窗上使用物理屏障，例如普通纱窗或网状纱窗或经过杀虫剂处理的网材料，并保持门窗关闭；和</li><li>白天<em>伊蚊</em>最活跃时，睡在蚊帐下。</li></ul><p>为了避免寨卡病毒感染的性传播风险，男性和女性应采取更安全的性行为，包括坚持使用安全套或禁欲</p><h3>回国后</h3><p>为了防止寨卡病毒继续传播，从可能传播寨卡病毒和其他蚊媒病毒的地区返回到有有效蚊媒的地区的旅行者应继续使用驱虫剂至少三周，以避免被叮咬并可能传播感染通过蚊子叮咬传染给其他人。</p><p>为了防止寨卡病毒感染引起的不良妊娠和胎儿结局，所有从可能存在寨卡病毒传播的地区返回的旅行者都应采取更安全的性行为，包括正确和持续使用安全套，或考虑在寨卡病毒感染后至少三个月内避免性行为。男性旅客最后一次可能接触的时间，女性旅客最后一次可能接触的时间为两个月。孕妇的性伴侣应采取更安全的性行为或至少在怀孕期间禁欲。</p><p>出现可能感染寨卡病毒症状（例如皮疹、发烧、关节疼痛、红眼）的回国旅行者应联系其医疗保健提供者，告知其旅行史，并根据指示接受实验室检测和临床护理。</p><p>怀孕回国旅客在寻求护理时应告知医疗保健提供者其旅行史。目前不建议对没有任何症状、也没有异常超声结果的怀孕回国旅客进行寨卡病毒感染的常规检测。</p><p></p>",,,2019-07-15,,"[""美国"", ""中非""]",,https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/information-for-travellers-visiting-countries-with-zika-virus-transmission,who_situation_reports,,,,,,"[""寨卡病毒病""]",,,,,,,,,,2023-12-21 02:29:56,2023-12-21 02:29:56,,,,

<h3>Overview </h3>
<h3>Key updates</h3><ul><li>Countries, territories and subnational areas reporting vector-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) infections for the first time since 1 February:</li><ul><li>None</li></ul><li>Countries and territories reporting microcephaly and other central nervous system malformations potentially associated with ZIKV infection for the first time since 1 February:</li><ul><li>Mexico, Saint Martin</li></ul><li>Countries and territories reporting Guillain-Barré syndrome cases associated with ZIKV infection for the first time since 1 February:</li><ul><li>Curaçao, Trinidad and Tobago</li></ul><li>WHO, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have developed a new Zika virus classification scheme. The classification serves to categorize the presence of and potential for vector-borne ZIKV transmission and to inform public health recommendations. Based on the defined criteria and expert review, some countries, territories and subnational areas were reclassified and some were classified for the first time.</li><li>In line with WHO’s transition to a sustained programme to address the long-term nature of the disease and its consequences, this is the final WHO Zika situation report. WHO will continue to publish the Zika classification table (Table 1) on a regular basis as well as periodic situation analysis.</li></ul><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Category 1: Area with new introduction or re-introduction with ongoing transmission</h3><ul><li>A laboratory-confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne case of ZIKV infection in a country /territory/subnational area where there is no evidence of virus circulation before 2015, whether it is detected and reported by the country /territory/subnational area where infection occurred, or by another country by diagnosis of a returning traveller; or</li><li>A laboratory-confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne case of ZIKV infection in a country/territory/subnational area where transmission has been previously interrupted, whether it is detected and reported by the country where infection occurred, or by another country by diagnosis of a returning traveller.</li></ul><h3>Category 2: Area either with evidence of virus circulation before 2015 or area with ongoing transmission that is no longer in the new or re-introduction phase, but where there is no evidence of interruption</h3><p>This category takes into account those countries with known historical laboratory evidence of ZIKV circulation prior to 2015, based on the literature as well as all ZIKV surveillance data whether detected and reported by the country where infection occurred or by another country reporting a confirmed case in a returning traveller. Countries in this category may have seasonal variations in transmission. These countries may also experience outbreaks of ZIKV disease.</p><h4>Laboratory criteria to ascertain the presence of ZIKV in past studies are:</h4><ul><li>Detection of the virus in humans, mosquitoes or animals; and/or</li><li>Serologic confirmation of ZIKV infection with tests conducted after 1980, and considered as confirmed infection on expert review based on testing for all appropriate cross-reactive flaviviruses and utilization of comprehensive testing methodologies. Because of testing and interpretation limitations with serological data antedating 1980, they were not used for classification purposes.</li></ul><h3>Category 3: Area with interrupted transmission and with potential for future transmission</h3><p>The minimum timeline for determining transition to an interrupted state is 12 months after the last confirmed case, and no cases identified in travellers. For countries with a high capacity for diagnostic testing, consistent timely reporting of diagnostic results, a comprehensive arboviral surveillance system and/or a temperate climate or island setting, the interruption of vector-borne transmission is defined as the absence of ZIKV infection 3 months after the last confirmed case. Countries where interruption is epidemiologically likely to have occurred should provide surveillance data to WHO to support the assessment by expert review.</p><h3>Category 4: Area with established competent vector but no known documented past or current transmission</h3><p>All countries/territories/subnational areas where the main competent vector (A. aegypti) is established, but which have not had a documented, autochthonous, vector-borne case of ZIKV infection. This category also includes a subgroup of countries/ territories /subnational areas where ZIKV transmission may occur because of a shared border with a neighbouring Category 2 country, by belonging to the same ecological zone and having evidence of dengue virus transmission. In this subgroup, a first laboratory-confirmed, autochthonous vector-borne case of ZIKV infection may not necessarily indicate new introduction (Category 1), but rather previously unknown and undetected transmission (Category 2), and these countries/territories/subnational areas will be reclassified accordingly.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------</p><h3>Analysis</h3><ul><li>Overall, the global risk assessment has not changed. ZIKV continues to spread geographically to areas where competent vectors are present. Although a decline in cases of Zika virus infection has been reported in some countries, or in some parts of countries, vigilance needs to remain high.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p>

However, Zika virus and associated consequences remains a significant enduring public health challenge. Research has demonstrated the link between Zika virus infection and microcephaly, furthering the need for a robust technical mechanism to manage the global response and research agenda. The coordination and response to Zika virus is being escalated into a sustained programme of work with dedicated resources to address the long-term nature of the disease and its consequences. Recommendations from previous EC meetings will remain in place for three months while WHO implements the transition plan to shift activities into a longer-term programme. Building on established mechanisms and guided by the Zika Strategic Response Plan, WHO continues to coordinate and support more than 60 partners in the areas of detection, prevention, care and support, and research to strengthen preparedness and response in countries and territories where the&nbsp;<em>Aedes</em>&nbsp;mosquitoes are established.</li></ul><p>-------------------------------------</p><h3>Analysis</h3><ul><li>Overall, the global risk assessment has not changed.

Since attempts at genetic sequencing of this virus were unsuccessful, it is not known whether the mothers were infected with a strain of virus related to those previously isolated in Southeast Asia, or if there has instead been transmission of a virus strain imported from the Americas. A programme for active surveillance of microcephaly was established in February 2016 in Thailand, and is in the process of being integrated into routine arrangements for surveillance of birth defects. If a Zika virus strain previously circulating in Southeast Asia was found to be linked to microcephaly or other complications, it would have significant impact on the global risk assessment, as it would demonstrate that Zika-associated complications are not limited to the “Asian” strain circulating since 2013 in the Western Pacific Region, the Region of the Americas, and Cabo Verde.</li><li>The risk of Zika-associated complications in countries thought to be endemic for Zika virus remains largely unknown, due both to uncertainty about the risk associated with different Zika strains, and due to uncertainty about population immunity in these endemic settings.

Thailand, in the South-East Asia Region, has also recently reported Zika cases. It is not clear whether the apparent recent increase in the number of reported Zika cases is due to an actual increase in incidence or whether this is the result of enhanced surveillance, testing or awareness.</li><li>The sequencing results from two Zika virus cases reported in Malaysia indicate that both are from the “Asian” lineage but are from slightly different strains. The first imported case is similar to the virus that was circulating in French Polynesia in 2013, i.e., a post-2007 “Asian” strain. The second locally acquired case is reported to be a similar to a previously circulating Southeast Asian strain of the “Asian” lineage.</li><li>Further sequencing analysis in Singapore indicates that in addition to the locally acquired cases which were caused by viruses from older strains of the “Asian” lineage, an imported case with travel history to Brazil was found to be caused by a virus similar to the strain of the “Asian” lineage currently circulating in the Americas.</li><li>Countries and territories reporting microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) malformations potentially associated with Zika virus infection for the first time in the past week:</li><ul><li>Guatemala</li></ul><li>Countries and territories reporting Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) cases associated with Zika virus infection for the first time in the past week:</li><ul><li>Ecuador</li></ul><li>The 2016 Summer Paralympic Games closed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 18 September. WHO assesses the individual risk of Zika virus infection in travellers returning from the Paralympic Games as low, albeit not zero. To date, WHO has not received any official notification of Zika cases associated with this event. In accordance with WHO guidance, men and women returning should adopt safer sex practices or consider abstinence for at least 6 months upon return and apply insect repellent for at least 3 weeks upon return to reduce the risk of onward transmission.</li></ul><p>-----------------------------------------</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

Canada is the latest country to report a case of congenital malformation associated with a travel-related case of Zika virus infection. Four of the 15 total countries reported microcephaly cases born from mothers in countries with no endemic Zika virus transmission but who reported recent travel history to Zika-affected countries in the WHO Region of the Americas (Table 3).</li><li>As of 10 August 2016, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) reported 15 live-born infants with birth defects and six pregnancy losses with birth defects with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection.</li><li>As of 10 August 2016, 16 countries and territories worldwide have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases (Table 4). Grenada is the latest country to report a case of GBS associated with a confirmed Zika virus infection.</li><li>In Guinea-Bissau, on 29 June 2016, Institute Pasteur Dakar (IPD) laboratory technicians confirmed that three of 12 samples tested positive for Zika by PC-R. All 12 samples tested negative against IgM Zika. One additional sample from a recent case also tested positive for Zika virus infection. All four samples were sent to IPD on 1 July for gene sequencing and the results are pending. Results from the 22 additional samples collected from the Bijagos archipelago and sent to IPD are negative with ELISA and PCR testing. The same samples were also sent to Dakar for confirmation. A further total of 12 new samples were collected and results are still pending.</li><li>Two cases of microcephaly have been reported in the Western region of Gabu in Guinea-Bissau. The family members of the two children with microcephaly have not travelled outside Guinea-Bissau. The investigations regarding these two cases are ongoing. Trainings for regional health staff on the Zika case definition and other areas are planned to help ensure that cases are detected efficiently and effectively.</li><li>The joint mission by staff from the WHO Regional Office for Africa and from WHO headquarters to Guinea-Bissau has concluded and priority activities and gaps were identified as the following: additional financial resources to reinforce leadership and coordination mechanisms of the Emergency operations Centre (EOC); reinforcement of epidemiologic and entomologic surveillance systems; increasing laboratory capacity at three levels; strengthening of response to Zika cases in terms of detection, community involvement and risk communication; and continued monitoring of Zika virus and its complications.</li><li>Zika virus test kits have been made available by the local authorities at the Central Public Health Laboratory in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and symptomatic athletes, volunteers, visitors and residents are encouraged to get tested.</li><li>WHO has developed advice and information on diverse topics in the context of Zika virus.</li></ul>

<h3>Overview </h3>
<h3>Summary</h3><ul><li>WHO and partners established a definition of what constitutes an outbreak, endemic transmission, and the interruption of mosquito-borne transmission in order to better characterize the level of transmission of Zika virus infection (Table 1, Fig. 2). This classification system was put into use as of the situation report of 7 July 2016.</li><li>As of 27 July 2016, 67 countries and territories (Fig. 1, Table 1) have reported evidence of mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission since 2007 (64 of these countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission since 2015):</li><ul><li>50 countries and territories with a first reported outbreak from 2015 onwards (Table 1).</li><li>Four countries are classified as having possible endemic transmission or have reported evidence of local mosquito-borne Zika infections in 2016.</li><li>13 countries and territories have reported evidence of local mosquito-borne Zika infections in or before 2015, but without documentation of cases in 2016, or with the outbreak terminated.</li></ul><li>One country and one territory have reported mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission for the first time in the week to 27 July 2016, Antigua and Barbuda; and Turks and Caicos (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland).</li><li>Since February 2016, 11 countries have reported evidence of person-to-person transmission of Zika virus, probably via a sexual route (Table 2).</li><li>One case of Zika virus infection, whose mode of transmission is currently being investigated, was recently reported in Utah, United States of America (USA). The case is a family contact of an individual who died in June. The blood samples of the deceased case were found to have high levels of Zika virus, more than 100 000 times higher than what has been found in samples from other infected persons. Result of the investigation on the mode of transmission is pending.</li><li>Two non travel-related Zika infections are currently being investigated in Florida, United States of America.</li><li>As of 27 July 2016, 14 countries or territories have reported microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) malformations potentially associated with Zika virus infection or suggestive of congenital infection. Paraguay is the latest country to report microcephaly with two cases of microcephaly associated with laboratory confirmed Zika virus infection recently documented. Three of the 14 total countries reported microcephaly cases born from mothers in countries with no endemic Zika virus transmission but who reported recent travel history to Zika-affected countries in the WHO Region of the Americas (Table 3).</li><li>In Spain, the first baby with microcephaly linked with in-utero Zika infection was born. This microcephaly case was first reported at the end of May.</li><li>As of 27 July 2016, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) reported 12 live-born infants with birth defects and six pregnancy losses with birth defects with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection.</li><li>As of 27 July 2016, 15 countries and territories worldwide have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases (Table 4).</li><li>Based on research to date, there is scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and GBS.</li><li>In Guinea-Bissau, on 29 June 2016, Institute Pasteur Dakar (IPD) confirmed that three of 12 samples tested positive for Zika by PC-R. All 12 samples tested negative against IgM Zika. One additional sample from a recent case also tested positive for Zika virus infection. All four samples were sent to IPD on 1 July for gene sequencing and the results are pending. Twenty-two additional samples were collected and sent for testing; the results are still pending. The government of Guinea-Bissau with support from the WHO Country Office (WCO) is demonstrating strong leadership in response to these findings. A national Zika-inter-ministerial committee which is chaired by the Prime Minister and vice-chaired by the Minister of Health was established. The joint mission to Guinea-Bissau has arrived in the country to support the Ministry of Health’s response and to conduct an in-depth investigation of the situation. Technical material and financial support are also being provided by partners including US-CDC, Portuguese cooperation, IPD and UNICEF.</li><li>A roster of WHO technical experts will be available to answer media queries during the Olympics.</li><li>The global Strategic Response Framework launched by WHO in February 2016 encompasses surveillance, response activities and research. An interim report describing some of the key activities being undertaken jointly by WHO and international, regional and national partners in response to this public health emergency was published on 27 May 2016. A revised strategy for the period of July 2016 to December 2017 was published on 17 June.</li><li>WHO has developed advice and information on diverse topics in the context of Zika virus. WHO’s latest information materials, news and resources to support corporate and programmatic risk communication and community engagement are available online.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>

This classification system was put into use as of the situation report of 7 July 2016.</li><li>As of 20 July 2016, 65 countries and territories (Fig. 1, Table 1) have reported evidence of mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission since 2007 (62 of these countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission since 2015):</li><ul><li>48 countries and territories with a first reported outbreak from 2015 onwards (Table 1).</li><li>Four countries are classified as having possible endemic transmission or have reported evidence of local mosquito-borne Zika infections in 2016.</li><li>13 countries and territories have reported evidence of local mosquito-borne Zika infections in or before 2015, but without documentation of cases in 2016, or with the outbreak terminated.</li></ul><li>No new country or territory has reported mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission in the week to 20 July 2016.</li><li>Eleven countries have reported evidence of person-to-person transmission of Zika virus, probably via a sexual route (Table 2).</li><li>One case of Zika virus infection, whose mode of transmission is currently being investigated, was recently reported in the United States of America. The case is a family contact of an individual who died in June. The blood samples of the deceased case were found to have high amounts of Zika virus, more than 100 000 times higher than what has been found in other samples of infected people.</li><li>The first documented case of female-to-male sexual transmission of Zika virus infection was reported in the United States of America on 15 July 2016.</li><li>As of 20 July 2016, 13 countries or territories have reported microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) malformations potentially associated with Zika virus infection or suggestive of congenital infection. Three of those countries reported microcephaly cases born from mothers with a recent travel history to Zika-affected countries in the WHO Region of the Americas (Table 3).</li><li>As of 20 July 2016, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) reported nine live-born infants with birth defects and six pregnancy losses with birth defects with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection.</li><li>As of 20 July 2016, 15 countries and territories worldwide have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases (Table 4).</li><li>Based on research to date, there is scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and GBS.</li><li>In Guinea-Bissau, on 29 June 2016, Institute Pasteur Dakar (IPD) confirmed that four of 12 samples tested positive for Zika by PCR. All 12 samples tested negative against IgM Zika. Four additional samples were sent to IPD on 1 July for gene sequencing and the results are still pending.</li><li>The government of Guinea-Bissau with support from the WHO Country Office (WCO) is demonstrating strong leadership in response to these findings.

<h3>Overview </h3>
<h3>he third meeting of the Emergency Committee (EC) regarding microcephaly and other neurological disorders</h3><p>The third meeting of the Emergency Committee (EC) convened by the Director-General under the International Health Regulations (2005) regarding microcephaly, other neurological disorders and Zika virus was held by teleconference on 14 June 2016.</p><p>The committee concurred with the international scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and GBS, and, consequently, that Zika virus infection and its associated congenital and other neurological disorders is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Based on the existing evidence from the current Zika virus outbreak, it is known that this virus can spread internationally and establish new transmission chains in areas where the vector is present.</p><p>Focusing on the potential risks associated with the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Committee reviewed information provided by Brazil and Advisors specializing in arboviruses, the international spread of infectious diseases, travel medicine, mass gatherings and bioethics. The Committee concluded that there is a very low risk of further international spread of Zika virus as a result of the Olympic and Paralympic Games as Brazil will be hosting the Games during the Brazilian winter when the intensity of autochthonous transmission of arboviruses, such dengue and Zika viruses, will be minimal and is intensifying vector-control measures in and around the venues for the Games which should further reduce the risk of transmission.</p><p>---------------------------------------</p><h3>Summary</h3><ul><li>As of 15 June 2016, 60 countries and territories report continuing mosquito-borne transmission of which:</li><ul><li>46 countries are experiencing a first outbreak of Zika virus since 2015, with no previous evidence of circulation, and with ongoing transmission by mosquitos.</li><li>14 countries reported evidence of Zika virus transmission between 2007 and 2014, with ongoing transmission.</li></ul><li>In addition, four countries or territories have reported evidence of Zika virus transmission between 2007 and 2014, without ongoing transmission: Cook Islands, French Polynesia, ISLA DE PASCUA – Chile and YAP (Federated States of Micronesia).</li><li>Ten countries have reported evidence of person-to-person transmission of Zika virus, probably via a sexual route.</li><li>In the week to 15 June 2016, no new country reported mosquito-borne or person-to-person Zika virus transmission.</li><li>As of 15 June 2016, microcephaly and other central nervous system (CNS) malformations potentially associated with Zika virus infection or suggestive of congenital infection have been reported by twelve countries or territories. Three of those reported microcephaly cases borne from mothers with a recent travel history to Brazil (Slovenia, United States of America), the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Colombia (Spain), for one additional case the precise country of infection is not determined (as the case travelled to 3 known affected countries in Latin America).</li><li>A first case of microcephaly associated with Zika infection was confirmed in El Salvador.</li><li>A case of microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities, from a mother with recent travel to Honduras, is currently under verification for Zika virus in the United States of America.</li><li>As of 15 June, Cabo Verde has reported a total of six cases of microcephaly and/or other neurological abnormalities with serological indication of previous Zika infection.</li><li>In the context of Zika virus circulation, 13 countries and territories worldwide have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases.</li><li>Zika infection was diagnosed in 3 patients with a severe neurological condition in Guadeloupe.</li><li>Sequencing of the virus that causes the Zika outbreak in Cabo Verde showed that the virus is of the Asian lineage and the same as the one that circulates in Brazil.

<h3>Overview </h3>
<h3>Summary</h3><ul><li>The second meeting of the Emergency Committee was convened by the Director-General under the International Health Regulations (2005) on 8 March 2016. The Committee advised that the clusters of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders in some areas affected by Zika virus continue to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and that there is increasing evidence that there is a causal relationship with Zika virus.</li><li>Between 1 January 2007 and 9 March 2016, a total of 52 countries and territories have reported autochthonous (local) transmission or indication of transmission of Zika virus (41 since 1 January 2015). The Philippines is the latest to report autochthonous transmission of Zika virus. Five of these countries and territories reported a Zika virus outbreak that is now over. In addition, three countries have reported locally acquired infection in the absence of any known mosquito vectors, probably through sexual transmission.</li><li>The geographical distribution of Zika virus has steadily widened since the virus was first detected in the Americas in 2014. Autochthonous Zika virus transmission has been reported in 31 countries and territories of this region.</li><li>So far an increase in microcephaly and other neonatal malformations has only been reported in Brazil and French Polynesia, although two cases linked to a stay in Brazil were detected in the United States of America and Slovenia. Reported cases of microcephaly and/or congenital malformation in Colombia are under investigation.</li><li>In the context of Zika virus circulation, nine countries or territories have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases.</li><li>A recently published cohort study in Brazil shows an increased risk of microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities associated with a Zika virus infection during pregnancy and provides further information to support the possible causal relationship between Zika virus and microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities.</li><li>The global prevention and control strategy launched by WHO as a Strategic Response Framework encompasses surveillance, response activities and research, and this situation report is organized under those headings.</li></ul><p><img src=""http://origin.who.int/entity/emergencies/zika-virus/situation-report/Brazil_microcephaly_20160310ForWeb.jpg""></p><p><img src=""http://origin.who.int/entity/emergencies/zika-virus/situation-report/Zika-gbs-mc-americas850.jpg""></p><p><img src=""http://origin.who.int/entity/emergencies/zika-virus/situation-report/zikagbs-mc-asia850.jpg""></p><br><h3></h3>

<h3>Overview </h3>
<h3>Summary</h3><ul><li>Between 1 January 2007 and 25 February 2016, a total of 52 countries and territories have reported autochthonous (local) transmission of Zika virus, including those where the outbreak is now over and countries and territories that provided indirect evidence of local transmission. Among the 52 countries and territories, Marshall Islands, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago are the latest to report autochthonous transmission of Zika virus.</li><li>The geographical distribution of Zika virus has steadily widened since the virus was first detected in the Americas in 2015. Autochthonous Zika virus transmission has been reported in 31 countries and territories of this region. Zika virus is likely to be transmitted and detected in other countries within the geographical range of competent mosquito vectors, especially&nbsp;<em>Aedes aegypti</em>.</li><li>So far an increase in microcephaly cases and other neonatal malformations have only been reported in Brazil and French Polynesia, although two cases linked to a stay in Brazil were detected in two other countries.</li><li>During 2015 and 2016, eight countries and territories have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases.</li><li>Evidence that neurological disorders, including microcephaly and GBS, are linked to Zika virus infection remains circumstantial, but a growing body of clinical and epidemiological data points towards a causal role for Zika virus.</li><li>The global prevention and control strategy launched by WHO as a Strategic Response Framework encompasses surveillance, response activities and research, and this situation report is organized under those headings. Following consultation with partners and taking changes in caseload into account, the framework will be updated at the end of March 2016 to reflect epidemiological evidence coming to light and the evolving division of roles and responsibilities for tackling this emergency.</li></ul><p><img src=""http://origin.who.int/entity/emergencies/zika-virus/situation-report/Zika_SiteRep_Americas_timeline487px.jpg""></p><p><img src=""http://origin.who.int/entity/emergencies/zika-virus/situation-report/Zika_SiteRep_AsiaPacific_timeline487px.jpg""></p><p><img src=""http://origin.who.int/entity/emergencies/zika-virus/situation-report/brazil_microcephaly29-feb480.jpg""></p>

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>The influenza A(H7N9) virus is one subgroup among the larger group of H7 viruses, which normally circulate among birds. Human infections with other subgroups of H7 influenza viruses (H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7) have previously been reported in Australia, Canada, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Most of these infections occurred in association with poultry outbreaks. The infections mainly resulted in conjunctivitis and mild upper respiratory symptoms, with the exception of one death, which occurred in the Netherlands. Since the first notification at the end of March 2013, China has been reporting to WHO cases of human infection with H7N9 virus. This is the first time infection with this virus has been found in humans.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><span style=""font-family:open_sanssemibold, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;""><strong></strong></span><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>
","禽流感病毒 A(H7N9)类型在人类中的感染情况简介背景

禽流感病毒 A(H7N9) 型最早于 2013 年在中国江苏省发现，在当地家禽和环境中普遍存在，并已传播到其他国家和地区。截至 2023 年 6 月 11 日，世界卫生组织 (WHO) 已收到 868 例确认的人类感染病例，其中 461 人死亡。

人感染禽流感病毒 A(H7N9) 主要是通过直接接触感染的家禽或受污染的环境。人群中人传人的现象很少见，但已在密切接触者的家庭聚集病例中得到证实。

人感染禽流感病毒 A(H7N9) 的症状与其他流感病毒感染相似，包括发热、咳嗽、喉咙痛、肌肉疼痛、头痛和疲劳。严重的病例可能发展为肺炎、急性呼吸窘迫综合征 (ARDS) 和多器官衰竭。

目前还没有针对禽流感病毒 A(H7N9) 的特定治疗方法。治疗主要支持性，包括抗病毒药物、呼吸支持和并发症管理。

预防禽流感病毒 A(H7N9) 感染的最重要措施是避免接触感染的家禽或受污染的环境。个人还应采取预防措施，例如勤洗手、避免接触病人并接种流感疫苗。

正在进行研究以开发针对禽流感病毒 A(H7N9) 的疫苗和治疗方法。

As part of these efforts, candidate vaccine viruses are being developed and made available by the WHO GISRS.&nbsp;These recommendations reflect current understanding of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus causing human disease. WHO continues to monitor the situation closely for any changes that may affect the recommendations contained in this document. Should any factors change, WHO will issue a further update.

<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is an overview of the emergence and characteristics of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infecting humans in China in early 2013. The public health and animal health investigations of the outbreak were facilitated by rapid sharing of information and viruses. Epidemiologic studies and laboratory analyses of virus isolates have provided a vast amount of information in a very short time. Molecular and functional characterization of the virus revealed its possible origins and supported the development of diagnostic tests and vaccines as well as offering clinical guidance on antiviral therapy. Studies in animal models have started to shed light on pathogenicity and risk assessment. These activities have been essential in guiding disease control interventions and informing pandemic preparedness actions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><span style=""font-family:open_sanssemibold, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;""><strong></strong></span><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first step in the long cycle of vaccine development and production is vaccine virus selection and the development&nbsp; of&nbsp; high-growth reassortants (candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs)). This is a well established process and has been in place since the 1970s. It was further strengthened during the response to A(H5N1) and pandemic A(H1N1 2009, mainly through the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) which currently comprises 150 laboratories in 111 countries. Since the detection of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China, GISRS has been on alert. Through the excellent work undertaken by the WHO Collaborating Centre (WHO CC) in Beijing, viruses have been isolated and shipped to other WHO CCs and Essential Regulatory Laboratories (ERLs) of GISRS for joint virus characterization, development of diagnostic tests, risk assessment and candidate vaccine virus development for pandemic preparedness purposes.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><span style=""font-family:open_sanssemibold, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;""><strong></strong></span><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>In the past few weeks, WHO has received from China reports of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus. The influenza A(H7N9) virus is one subgroup among the larger group of H7 viruses, which normally circulate among birds. Human infections with other subgroups of H7 influenza viruses (H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7) have previously been reported in the Netherlands, Italy, Canada, United States of America, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Most of these infections occurred in association with poultry outbreaks. The infections mainly resulted in conjunctivitis and mild upper respiratory symptoms, with the exception of one death, which occurred in the Netherlands. These recent reports from China are the first cases of human infection with H7N9 viruses.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><span style=""font-family:open_sanssemibold, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;""><strong></strong></span><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>

<h3>Overview </h3>
<h3>Summary</h3><ul><li>From 1 January 2007 to 16 March 2016, Zika virus transmission was documented in a total of 59 countries and territories. Cuba and Dominica are the latest to report autochthonous (local) transmission of Zika virus on 14 and 15 March, respectively. Five of these countries and territories reported a Zika virus outbreak that is now over. Three countries (France, Italy and United States of America) have reported locally acquired infection in the absence of any known mosquito vectors, probably through sexual transmission.</li><li>The geographical distribution of Zika virus has steadily widened since the virus was first detected in the Americas in 2014. Autochthonous Zika virus transmission has been reported in 33 countries and territories of this region.</li><li>So far an increase in microcephaly and other fetal malformations has been reported in Brazil and French Polynesia, although two additional cases linked to a stay in Brazil were detected in the United States of America and Slovenia.</li><li>In the context of Zika virus circulation 12 countries or territories have reported an increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and/or laboratory confirmation of a Zika virus infection among GBS cases.</li><li>The mounting evidence from observational, cohort and case-control studies indicates that Zika virus is highly likely to be a cause of microcephaly, GBS and other neurologic disorders. Among the tasks ahead are to further quantify the risk of neurologic disorders following Zika virus infection, and to investigate the biological mechanisms that lead to neurologic disorders.</li><li>The global prevention and control strategy launched by WHO as a Strategic Response Framework encompasses surveillance, response activities and research, and this situation report is organized under those headings.</li></ul><p><img src=""http://origin.who.int/entity/emergencies/zika-virus/situation-report/Brazil_microcephaly_CurrentWeekForWeb.jpg""></p><p><img src=""http://origin.who.int/entity/emergencies/zika-virus/situation-report/Combined_Status_Zika_GBS_MC_Americas_20160317ForWeb.jpg""></p>
